# Bamazon
Using mySql, Javascript and Node.js- create an amazon like application!

There are two different files. bamazonCustomer and bamazonManager.

1. bamazonCustomer.js
    - You'll be shown a table of items. You will then be asked which item you would like to purchase from the table, then how many. If the item is in stock you will be given your total and checked out. If that item / those amount are not in stock you'll be told to choose a new item.
    - It will also subtract the amount available from the mySQL database when you choose an item. 

2. bamazonManager.js
    - This file will give you 4 options to start with:
        - Option 1: This option will displasy all the products in the table and then end the application. 
        - Option 2: This option will display to you all the items with less than 5 in stock. This is benefical to add new items when they are running low. 
        - Option 3: This option will allow you to add more inventory as you please. It will ask you the ID of the item, and then how many of them you'd like to add. It'll add that many on top of how many are currently in stock. 
        - Option 4: This option will let you add a whole new item to the mySQL database. It will ask you the item name, then the department, then the price, then the amount you would like to add.

        AND THATS BAMAZON! ENJOY!
